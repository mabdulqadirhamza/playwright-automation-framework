> A comprehensive end-to-end test automation framework built with Playwright and the Page Object Model pattern, featuring automated CI/CD pipelines and beautiful Allure reports.

## 📖 About This Project

This is a real-world automation testing framework I built to demonstrate professional QA engineering practices. It tests the [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com/) website, covering everything from simple form submissions to complex drag-and-drop interactions.

What makes this framework special:
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows the Page Object Model for maintainable, reusable code
- **Automated CI/CD**: Every push triggers tests and generates reports automatically
- **Visual Reports**: Beautiful Allure reports deployed to GitHub Pages
- **Production-Ready**: Includes retry logic, screenshots on failure, and parallel execution

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mabdulqadirhamza/demoQA-automation-framework.git
cd YOUR_REPO

# Install dependencies

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

Every push to `main` triggers:
1. **Install Dependencies** - Sets up Node.js and installs packages
2. **Install Browsers** - Downloads Chromium for testing
3. **Run Tests** - Executes all test suites in parallel
4. **Generate Report** - Creates Allure report with history
5. **Deploy to GitHub Pages** - Publishes report automatically

**View Live Reports**: [https://mabdulqadirhamza.github.io/demoQA-automation-framework/]
## 🎨 Features

- **Page Object Model**: Clean separation of test logic and page interactions
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests run concurrently for faster feedback
- **Auto-Retry**: Failed tests retry automatically (2 times on CI)
- **Screenshots**: Captures screenshots on test failures
- **Trace Files**: Records traces for debugging failed tests
- **Allure Reports**: Beautiful, interactive test reports with history
- **GitHub Actions**: Fully automated CI/CD pipeline
- **Cross-Browser Ready**: Configured for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Playwright** - Modern end-to-end testing framework
- **JavaScript/Node.js** - Programming language
- **Allure** - Test reporting framework
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD automation
- **GitHub Pages** - Report hosting

## 📊 Sample Test

```javascript
test('Fill and submit practice form', async ({ page }) => {
  const formPage = new FormApplicationPage(page);
  
  await formPage.goto();
  await formPage.fillFirstName('John');
  await formPage.fillLastName('Doe');
  await formPage.fillEmail('john.doe@example.com');
  await formPage.selectGender('Male');
  await formPage.fillMobile('1234567890');
  await formPage.submitForm();
  
  await expect(formPage.successMessage).toBeVisible();
});
```
